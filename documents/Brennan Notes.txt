Brennan Notes
=============

CPU

Known to be a Z80 ; multi tasking 100 T state task switcher, skeleton windowing system.
Interrupted at 50Hz PAL Frame rate ? NMI/IRQ probably IM1.
Q: 3.5Mhz or 7Mhz clock ? 7Mhz might make RAM too costly for 1983 ?

ROM

Has to be at $0000 (w/o extra hardware on address bus !)
Was the LC3 OS planned to  be included in every cartridge ("2 chip computer")

- Working system would need at least Z80, ROM, RAM, ULA a la ZX81 :)

RAM/Display
32x16 bit small on PAL w/262 lines interlaced.
32x24 characters ? (768)
32x24 attributes ? (768) same FBPPPIII ? 
Bit in attributes or char which indicates where to take graphic memory from
Can switch char/attr address with bit set/reset to H.

Could be 64 characters with 2 attribute bits to save memory ? (No)
Could have the outstanding 256 bytes as 64 max UDGs rest from ROM shared w/workspace ? Memory contention/timing issues here ?
RAM memory expansion could mean more UDGs.
RAM in BASIC cartridge (could if really cheap disable colour RAM as an option)
2k x 8 (max) UDGs maybe ROM mappable to save memory
6116 about £4 (consumer prices) 4027 4kx1 DRAM about £1.50 (chip count)
6264 about £25 (and not available till 1984)
Could use 8 x 4116 (or broken RAM a la Spectrum) cost about £1 each

64us Scanline on PAL.
52us Visible.
40us (say) for display.
40/32 = 1.25us / char display ?
Other Hardware

xxxEMBBB on $FE, Keyboard device uses this as Spectrum ?
Console input devices as per Sinclair Joystick I/F read via port $F7FE

Sound
Not finalised.
Beeper as Spectrum.
R/2R D/A ladder
ULA latch/counter designs expensive on ULA space for 1983 ?
